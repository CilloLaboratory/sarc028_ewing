# SARC028 Ewing Sarcoma Analyses
## Overview
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures from "*Spatial transcriptomic analyses of Ewing sarcoma reveals absence of human leukocyte antigen class I as a potential mechanism of primary resistance to immunotherapy*" by Daley et al (manuscript in revision).
## Reproducibility
All code is provided as raw (.Rmd) rendered (.html) Rmarkdown files. The rendered HTML files contain the session information at the end to illustrate the packages and versions used. 
## Downloading data
The data necessary to recreate the analyses is available from [our record on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14982967). To execute the Rmarkdown files included in this repositry:
- Download the data from Zenodo into the 01_input directory of this repository
- Decompress the data files to use as input into the preprocessing and figure scripts
